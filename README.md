# ODWU-Tree
Reinforcement Learning Research Project in Fall 2017
## Objective
This project aimed at managing historical information, building a POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) model based on tree structure, and then solving problem using typical algorithm of POMDP model.
## Description
Lab: Intelligent Analysis and Decision Lab, Nanjing University
Subject: Reinforcement Learning Based on Markov Decision Process
+ Looked up related papers and materials to gain required knowledge
+ Mastered the reinforcement learning to build a tree with high complexity of computing
+ Innovated the existing reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the time-consuming part of the algorithm, and examined the efficiency of new algorithm
+ Recorded and summarized the result of the program, and wrote the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8371987)
